This discord bot is meant to substitute a memory gauge in the Digimon TCG when doing remote duels via webcam.
If anyone wishes to help contribute with the images feel free to contact 0xdema on discord, the counters are 80x80, and the gauges are 500,350 and have 2 example psd in the main folder.
Currently the first 15 are from scans of official memory gauges but this is not being used for any commercial usage. The next 2 counters were made by me but using an official image of the digimon.

In order to use this bot the environment variable LUNABOT_TOKEN must be set to your bot secret.
An alternative would be to just add the bot to your server below and have it added to your server.
